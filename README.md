1. **Run the Schema Setup**:
   ```bash
   python3 wev_db/create_tranformer_dataSchema.py

   - **Add a Whole Directory**:
     ```bash
     python3 wev_db/add_url_to_transformerDB.py --directory wev_db/player_urls/[category_directory]
     ```
   - **Add a Specific File**:
     ```bash
     python3 wev_db/add_url_to_transformerDB.py --file wev_db/player_urls/[category_directory]/[player_name]
     ```
