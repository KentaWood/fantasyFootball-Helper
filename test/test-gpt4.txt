1. Patrick Mahomes vs Sam Darnold who should I start in fantasy this week? N
While Darnold's recent surge is impressive, Mahomes' consistent high-level performance and favorable matchup make him the safer and more reliable choice for Week 15. Therefore, starting Patrick Mahomes would be the advisable decision for your fantasy lineup this week.

2. Bears Defense vs Texans Defense who should I start in fantasy this week? N
Given the Texans' recent defensive improvements and the Bears' struggles against potent offenses, starting the Houston Texans' defense may offer a slightly better opportunity for fantasy points in Week 15. However, it's important to monitor injury reports and consider the offensive strengths of their opponents when making your final decision.

3. Nico Collins vs A.J. Brown who should I start in fantasy this week? N 
A.J. Brown is the clear start this week. Brown has been one of the most dominant wide receivers this season, consistently putting up WR1 numbers, even against strong defenses. Nico Collins has shown promise as a rising talent, but his ceiling is limited compared to Brown’s elite production. Unless Brown is dealing with an injury or facing a top-tier defense, he remains the safer and higher-upside option.

4. Rashee Rice vs Keon Coleman who should I start in fantasy this week? N 
Start Rashee Rice. As part of the Chiefs' offense led by Patrick Mahomes, Rice has been steadily gaining targets and has become a reliable red-zone option. While Keon Coleman is an intriguing player with big-play ability, his usage and consistency don't match Rice's role in one of the league's most dynamic offenses. Rice offers a higher floor and ceiling this week.

5. Bo Nix vs Matthew Stafford who should I start in fantasy this week? Y 
Start Bo Nix. The Oregon quarterback has been a fantasy powerhouse in college leagues, thanks to his dual-threat ability and high-scoring offense. Stafford, while a proven veteran, has struggled with consistency and injury concerns this season. Unless you're in an NFL-only league, Nix provides far more upside for fantasy purposes.

6. Bengals Defense vs Texans Defense who should I start in fantasy this week? N 
Start Texans Defense. The Texans have been making plays on defense, showing an ability to generate turnovers and apply pressure on opposing quarterbacks. The Bengals defense, while solid, faces a tougher matchup that could limit their scoring potential. If you're looking for a defense with a higher ceiling this week, the Texans are the better choice.

7. Justin Tucker vs Chase McLaughlin who should I start in fantasy this week? Y 
Start Justin Tucker. Tucker remains the most reliable kicker in the NFL, with a proven track record of accuracy and consistency, even in difficult conditions. While McLaughlin has had some strong weeks, Tucker’s role in the Ravens’ efficient offense makes him the top choice in almost any matchup.

8. Harrison Butker vs Chase McLaughlin who should I start in fantasy this week? N 
Start Harrison Butker. Butker benefits from playing in one of the league's highest-scoring offenses, giving him plenty of opportunities for both field goals and extra points. While McLaughlin can be a decent streamer, Butker’s consistency and team context make him the better play.

9. Calvin Ridley vs Tyrone Tracy Jr. who should I start in fantasy this week? N
Start Calvin Ridley. Ridley has the pedigree and talent to deliver WR1 performances, even if his production has been inconsistent at times. Tracy Jr. is a riskier play, as he doesn’t command the same target share or offensive role as Ridley. Trust Ridley’s upside in this matchup.

10. Cedric Tillman vs Christian Watson who should I start in fantasy this week? Y 
Start Christian Watson. Watson’s big-play potential and role in the Packers’ offense give him an edge over Tillman, who has yet to establish himself as a consistent fantasy contributor. If you’re chasing upside, Watson is the better option this week.

1. (Patrick Mahomes, Sam Darnold) Y
This week, you should confidently start Sam Darnold over Patrick Mahomes. Darnold is on fire, coming off a game where he threw for 347 yards and five touchdowns against a weak Falcons defense, showcasing a high completion rate and a solid performance. He faces the Bears this week, who are among the easiest opponents to exploit. On the other hand, while Mahomes is a proven star, his recent performance has been underwhelming, and he faces a tough matchup against the Browns. His inconsistency with 20 touchdowns and 11 interceptions this season is concerning, making him a mid-range QB1 at best. With Darnold's rising momentum and favorable matchup, he offers a higher ceiling this week. Trust in the hot hand and start Darnold.

2. (Texans D/ST, Bears D/ST) I 
When deciding between the Texans D/ST and Bears D/ST this week, consider their recent performances and matchups. The Texans have shown flashes of potential, especially in their ability to generate sacks and turnovers, ranking high in sacks this season. However, they also allow a considerable number of points, which can limit their fantasy upside. On the other hand, the Bears D/ST has been more consistent in maintaining a lower points allowed tally and has also created turnovers recently. However, they face a challenging matchup against a more efficient offense. If you’re looking for a higher risk-reward play, the Texans might be the better option given their aggressive playstyle. Conversely, if you prefer a steadier and safer choice, opt for the Bears D/ST. Overall, assess the matchups closely and choose the one that aligns with your risk tolerance.

3. (Nico Collins, A.J. Brown) Y
In deciding between A.J. Brown and Nico Collins for your fantasy lineup this week, consider their recent performances. A.J. Brown has been inconsistent, catching only four passes for 43 yards in his last game, and has struggled to find the end zone lately. Despite being a talented receiver, his target volume seems to be declining, making him a risky start. On the other hand, Nico Collins is trending upward, having recently returned from injury and leading the Texans in receiving yards. He has shown reliable production and has the potential for a breakout game against a favorable matchup. Given their current trajectories, I'd recommend starting Nico Collins over A.J. Brown this week. His recent form and increased usage in the Texans' offense give him a higher ceiling, while Brown's inconsistency makes him a more uncertain option.

4. (Rashee Rice, Keon Coleman) I/Y
For this week's fantasy decisions, prioritize Joe Mixon over Tyrone Tracy Jr. Mixon has shown consistent performance, bouncing back with over 100 yards and a touchdown in his last game. He’s a key player in the Texans' offense, especially in the red zone and passing game, making him a reliable starter projected for 15.5 points. On the other hand, while Tyrone Tracy Jr. led the Giants in carries last week, his efficiency was concerning, averaging just 2.8 yards per carry. Although he scored a touchdown, his overall production is less promising. As for Rashee Rice and Keon Coleman, with Rice projected at 0.0 points and Coleman returning from injury, Coleman could be a sneaky flex option if he practices fully and shows no lingering effects from his wrist injury. Always check the latest news before finalizing your lineup!

5. (Bo Nix, Matthew Stafford) I
For this week's matchup, both Bo Nix and Matthew Stafford are projected similarly at 17.57 points. However, consider factors such as matchup strength, recent performance, and surrounding offensive talent. Bo Nix has been impressive lately, showcasing dual-threat capabilities, which can add extra fantasy points through rushing. If he continues to build on his recent success, he could outperform expectations. On the other hand, Matthew Stafford has been consistent but can be prone to tougher matchups, especially if his offensive line struggles against a strong pass rush. If you need a safer floor, Stafford might be the way to go. But if you’re feeling adventurous and want potential high upside, consider starting Nix. Ultimately, choose based on your league's scoring format and your risk tolerance.

6. (Bengals Defense, Texans Defense) N
In this matchup between the Bengals D/ST and the Texans D/ST, both teams have similar projections at 7.27 points. The Bengals D/ST has shown inconsistency, particularly in high-pressure games. They recently struggled against a strong Packers offense, which could be a concern. On the other hand, the Texans D/ST has been more aggressive, generating turnovers and sacks, ranking high in takeaways this season. They have the potential to capitalize on mistakes, especially against teams that struggle offensively. Given the current form, I would lean towards starting the Texans D/ST this week. Their upside in turnovers and ability to create pressure on the quarterback make them a slightly more favorable option in fantasy. However, monitor any injury updates that could impact their performance.

7. (Justin Tucker, Chase McLaughlin) Y
For your kicker dilemma, both Justin Tucker and Chase McLaughlin are projected equally, at 8.33 points. However, Tucker has a long-standing reputation as one of the best kickers in the league, consistently delivering high performance even in tough conditions. He has a history of making clutch kicks and rarely misses opportunities. On the other hand, McLaughlin has shown potential but lacks the same level of consistency and experience as Tucker. Given Tucker's proven track record and reliability, he is the safer choice in your fantasy lineup this week. Always consider matchups and recent performance, but in this case, going with Justin Tucker is advisable for maximizing your points.

8. (Harrison Butker, Chase McLaughlin)Y
In this matchup between Chase McLaughlin and Harrison Butker, both are projected to score the same points, making it a tough decision. However, consider the context of their respective teams and their recent performances. Chase McLaughlin has been solid, but his fantasy output can be inconsistent based on the team's offensive performance. On the other hand, Harrison Butker plays for a high-scoring offense, which increases his chances of scoring field goals and extra points. Given the equal projections, lean towards Butker due to the potential for more scoring opportunities in a high-powered offense. If you want a safer option this week, start Butker. However, keep an eye on injury reports and weather conditions, as these can impact kicker performance significantly.


9. (Calvin Ridley, Tyrone Tracy Jr.)Y
Between Calvin Ridley and Tyrone Tracy Jr., I recommend starting Calvin Ridley. Both players have similar projections, but Ridley has shown significant upside in recent weeks, averaging 19.66 Fantasy points over his last three games. His involvement in the offense has increased, especially after DeAndre Hopkins' trade, making him a focal point for the Titans. Ridley has a strong connection with quarterback Will Levis, which could lead to more big plays. On the other hand, Tyrone Tracy Jr. has had a solid performance but is still facing inefficiencies, as indicated by his low yards-per-carry average. While he is utilized in the offense, his ceiling appears capped compared to Ridley. Given Ridley’s potential for higher output, he's the safer and more promising choice for your lineup this week.


10. (Cedric Tillman, Christian Watson) Y
In this matchup, both Cedric Tillman and Christian Watson have identical projections, but their recent performances and roles in their respective offenses differ significantly. Watson has been a big-play threat for the Packers, averaging over 33 yards per catch in recent games, and despite some drops, he remains a focal point in their passing game. His ability to stretch the field gives him a higher ceiling. On the other hand, Tillman's role is less defined, making him a riskier option. Given Watson's explosive potential and recent performance, he’s the better choice to maximize your fantasy points this week. Starting Watson could capitalize on his big-play ability, especially if the Packers find themselves in a shootout.
